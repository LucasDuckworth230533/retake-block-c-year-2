- **Content Classification:** Categorizing TV content based on emotional intensity and type for better content recommendations and viewer warnings
- **Production Insights:** Helping producers identify emotionally engaging moments for highlights, trailers, and promotional content

### Secondary Use Cases
- Sentiment analysis in Dutch customer reviews, social media posts, or other textual data
- Creating subtitles with tone tags for the auditory impaired in Dutch content
- Emotion-aware chatbots and virtual assistants for Dutch speakers

### Limitations & Dataset Assessment
- The model is specifically trained for Dutch text and will not perform well on other languages
- **Significant class imbalance exists** with neutral and happiness classes dominating the dataset, while anger (37 samples) and disgust (93 samples) are severely underrepresented
- **Dataset bias assessment:** The transcription-based training data may contain inherent biases from the student population and company emotion pipeline, potentially affecting generalization to broader Dutch-speaking demographics
- The model might not generalize well to domains that differ significantly from the training data (e.g., highly specialized texts, code-switching, etc.)
- It may struggle with context-dependent emotions, where the emotional tone depends on surrounding sentences or external context
- Performance is expected to be particularly challenged on underrepresented classes due to insufficient training examples

## Data Preprocessing & Quality Assessment

**Source Datasets:**
- **Training Dataset:** Transcriptions from all student participants with emotions labeled by company pipeline
- **Test Dataset:** Transcriptions from our specific series with emotions labeled by company pipeline
- **Total Training Samples:** 3,855 datapoints
- **Test Dataset:** Separate dataset for evaluation

## Sustainability & Energy Usage

### Training Energy Consumption

**Training Configuration:**
- **Hardware:** Local GPU (estimated ~200W power draw)
- **Training Duration:** ~2 hours for 3 epochs (reduced from larger datasets)
- **Energy Calculation:** 
  - Energy (kWh) = Runtime (hours) × Power Draw (Watts) ÷ 1000
  - Training Energy = 2h × 200W ÷ 1000 = **0.4 kWh**

**Environmental Impact Context:**
- Equivalent to charging a smartphone ~33 times
- Same energy as running a microwave for 24 minutes
- **90% lower energy consumption** compared to training larger models (BERT-large)
- Significantly lower than cloud-based training due to local GPU usage

### Inference Energy Estimation

**Per Inference Calculation:**
- **GPU Power:** ~200W (estimated local GPU)
- **Inference Time:** ~0.08 seconds per sentence (optimized for 128 tokens)
- **Energy per Inference:** (200W × 0.08s) ÷ 3600 = **0.0044 Wh**

**Scaling Estimates:**

| Usage Scale | Energy Consumption | Real-World Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1,000 inferences | 4.4 Wh | Charging smartphone 1/3 full |
| 10,000 inferences | 44 Wh | Running laptop for 45 minutes |
| 100,000 inferences | 440 Wh (0.44 kWh) | Running dishwasher 3/4 cycle |
| 1,000,000 inferences | 4.4 kWh | Average household electricity for 4 hours |

**Monthly Usage Example:**
- 100 daily users × 10 inferences each × 20 days = 20,000 monthly inferences
- Monthly energy: 20,000 × 0.0044 Wh = **88 Wh (0.088 kWh)**
- Cost (at €0.25/kWh): **€0.022/month**

### Sustainability Recommendations

1. **Model Optimization:** Consider model distillation or quantization to reduce inference energy by additional 30-50%
2. **Batch Processing:** Process multiple texts simultaneously to reduce per-inference overhead
